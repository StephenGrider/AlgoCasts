## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save matched
```

## Usage

If non-glob patterns (e.g. file paths) are passed, only paths that exist on the file system are returned.

```js
var glob = require('matched');
```

**async**

```js
glob(['*.js'], function(err, files) {
  //=> ['utils.js', 'index.js']
});
```

**sync**

```js
var files = glob.sync(['*.js']);
//=> ['utils.js', 'index.js']
```

**promise**

```js
glob.promise(['*.txt'])
  .then(function(files) {
    //=> ['a.txt', 'b.txt', 'c.txt']
  });
```

**options**

All methods take options as the second argument:

```js
glob(['*.js'], {cwd: 'test'}, function(err, files) {
  //=> ['test.js']
});
```

## Release history

**v0.4.1**

* Exposes a non-enumerable `cache` property on the returned files array. This is a patch relase since the property does not change the existing API and should not otherwise effect behavior or results.
