# Data Structure

Ways of organizing information with optimal runtime complexity for adding or removing records

JS natively implements several data structures. You will be asked about 'inferior' data structures. 

-- JS Array has capability to do a tremendous number of things including a queue. A queue doesn't do all the things an array does. 

## Queue

-- a container where data enters one end of a container and exits out the other in. First In, First Out. 

##### Enqueuing === adding a record ===> array.unshift();

##### Dequeuing === removing a record ===> array.pop();

JS Arrays are useful for implementing a queue.
